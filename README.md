# Stock_Market_Analysis

What all terms come to our mind when we hear about the stock market? Shares, Price, High, Low to name a few. Well, to define the Stock Market, we can say it is a network of buyers and sellers that trade the stocks(not a physical or discrete entity) and the percent of stocks one owns tells about his ownership in that particular organization (the stocks of the organization brought or sold by him).

In this report we will ananlyze various factors that effect the stocks in the stock market. So, the Company datasets which we have with us for the analysis purpose are:-

1. Mindtree ( Representead as MT in the report)
